late submission

## Feedback:

The report is generally very well written, below I would like to comment
on examples of points which could be improved.

Before going into much detail, it might be better if you can introduce
the definition of each of the variables, i.e. TMIN, TMAX, etc… For the
second plot in section 2.1, the legend is not very needed, because it
shows repeated information with each of the subtitles. Also, when
computing the confidence interval, you should use t-distribution to
compute lower and upper quantiles, although this would not have a visual
difference.

For section 2.2, you can analyze and compare the residual variance of
each month and weather station, this will help with your explanations to
the p-values.

For the weather prediction, residual checks are always important for
fitted linear models. Good analysis on the location of each of the
weather stations. For the first table in section 3.1, you can put this
result in a line graph for each of the remaining weather stations
together with uncertainties for better comparison.

In section 3.2, good evaluation and assessment. It would be nice if you
could also include the a confidence interval for each of the months in
the plot to visualize uncertainties.
